#  Binary Basics in Networking

Binary = The language of computers. Everything ! data, IP addresses, ports -- is 0s and 1s.


## What is Binary?

- Binary is a **base-2**  system.
- Uses only 0 and 1.
- Computers see:
  - `0` = OFF
  - `1` = ON

##  Why Do We Need Binary in Networking?

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits â†’ made of binary.

Example:
**Decimal IP: 192.168.1.1
Binary IP:  11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001**
Each number (called **octet**) = 8 bits.

## ðŸ§® Convert Decimal to Binary (quick cheat)

| Decimal | Binary     |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 00000001   |
| 10      | 00001010   |
| 100     | 01100100   |
| 255     | 11111111   |

Each octet can go from `00000000 (0)` to `11111111 (255)`

## ðŸ“¦ Why It Matters:
- Needed to **understand IP addresses**
- Helps in **subnetting**
- Used in **network calculations**

## These numbers can help decode the binary codes :
  **128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1**
