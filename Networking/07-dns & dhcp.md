# Networking Notes

## DHCP & DNS

### DHCP
- Automatically assigns IP address and network settings
- Device requests IP, server offers, device accepts, server confirms
- Also provides subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, lease time
- Simplifies network management for many devices

### DNS
- Converts domain names to IP addresses
- Query flow: client → DNS server → response IP
- Layers: root servers → TLD servers → authoritative servers
- Vulnerable to attacks like DNS spoofing

### Summary
DHCP handles IP config automatically  
DNS resolves names to IPs  
Both are essential for smooth internet operation
