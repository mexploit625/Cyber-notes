#  Day 12 – June 12, 2025

## What I Learned  
Watched a video on DoS and DDoS attacks. Got the full picture of how these work. how DoS is a single machine attack while DDoS uses multiple systems like a swarm.  
Learned the difference between network-level and application-level DoS. Network-level is about flooding with traffic, while application-level targets specific app functions to slow things down or crash them.

 ## Realizations  
Not every attack is about stealing data. Some are just meant to break stuff and cause chaos.  
DDoS seems basic at first, but the scale and impact can be massive. Knowing the types makes it easier to understand how to defend against them.

## Next Steps  
Moving into phishing next. I want to understand how attackers trick people and how these social engineering attacks actually work.  
Might also check how phishing looks in real scenarios ,  emails, fake pages, stuff like that.

## Thoughts  
Starting to see how attackers think and that’s exactly what I need if I’m gonna defend anything.  
Every day is stacking knowledge, not just facts but actual understanding.  
Feels like I’m slowly stepping into the world I’ve been watching from the outside. No noise. Just focus.
