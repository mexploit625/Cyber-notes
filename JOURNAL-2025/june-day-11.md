# Day 11 – June 11, 2025

🧠 **What I Learned**  
Watched "3 Common Hacking Skills Everyone Has" , showed how basic stuff people do online can turn into vulnerabilities.  
Checked out “A Day in the Life of a Cybersecurity Analyst”-- got a better idea of what the job actually looks like day-to-day.

💡 **Realizations**  
Cybersecurity isn't just about technical skills. it’s also about awareness and mindset.  
The analyst job feels like it’s part routine, part putting out fires. I like that.

🎯 **Next Steps**  
Planning to watch content on DDoS attacks, darknet, and other common cyber threats.  
Might also look into phishing or DNS spoofing if time allows.

🗣️ **Thoughts**  
The screen’s cold, room's quiet, but my head's wired. I’ve seen enough today to know this isn’t just “something I’m learning”...it’s something I’m becoming.  
I don’t need loud wins or applause. Just a connection, a terminal, and time.  
The grind continues. Tomorrow’s waiting. And I’ll be there....**logged in**.
